# Delaginator
A project for collecting performance patches for Vanilla Rimworld and its DLCs.  These are targeted patches meant to improve the performance of particularly hot methods in vanilla's code.  The patches are designed to be as transparent as possible to minimize any gameplay effects or compatibilty issues.

This mod should be compatible with most other mods, but due to the nature of theses patches it's possible that mods which do deep or extensive Harmony patching may be incompatible.  Individual patches can be enabled/disabled in the mod settings if necessary.

In particular, this mod is compatible with Rocketman. The two mods target different performance issues, and you will get the most performance by using both together.
